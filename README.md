# Quantitative Trading Strategy Backtesting and Risk Management

## Strategy Implementation:
Developed an algorithmic trading strategy that integrates predictive signals into a backtesting framework. The model-generated predictions were used to determine daily trade entries by conditionally applying returns (i.e., executing a trade only when the prediction indicated a favorable signal). This process was implemented in Python using vectorized operations in Pandas and NumPy, ensuring efficient computation over historical time-series data.

## Portfolio Simulation & Performance Evaluation:
The strategy’s impact was evaluated by simulating portfolio growth. Starting from an initial capital of one unit, cumulative returns were computed using the daily strategy returns. Key features included:

-- Drawdown Analysis: Identified and highlighted the portfolio’s minimum value (by plotting a red marker on the drawdown point) to visualize adverse performance periods.
-- Visualization: Employed Matplotlib to plot portfolio evolution over time, facilitating an intuitive understanding of performance dynamics.
Risk-Adjusted Return Metrics:
-- Calculated the Sharpe ratio by annualizing both the mean strategy return and its volatility. The strategy achieved a Sharpe ratio of 0.482, indicating a moderate risk-adjusted performance where the returns are about half the level of risk taken. This metric underscored the balance between potential gains and inherent volatility, demonstrating a disciplined approach to risk management.

## Technical Proficiencies:
The project showcased advanced skills in data handling and quantitative analysis using Python, with particular emphasis on:

Time-series manipulation and vectorized computations.
Statistical evaluation of trading performance.
Clear and informative data visualization for performance diagnostics.
